       <h3>Overview</h3>
       <p>Project BlueHat aims to improve the safety of personnel at outdoor
         facilities in emergency situations by providing a new solution to
         emergency mustering. By adopting bluetooth low energy technology
         we remove the need for expensive hi-gain RFID antennas which existing
         solutions use. Project BlueHat trilaterates personnel using a peripheral
         bluetooth low energy device embedded into the top of safety hard-hats
         which advertise bio-sensor and RSSI (received signal strength indicator)
         data to many central bluetooth low energy nodes that are placed throughout
         a facility.
       </p>
       <p>
         These central devices relay data of scanned nearby peripheral
         devices to our backend server, where RSSI values of scanned peripheral
         devices are Kalman filtered for conversion to distance values.
         These distance values are then used to perform a trilateration of a
         peripheral device. By knowing the location of personnel in a facility
         during an emergency situation, we can determine who is moving to a
         designated safe zone or not, and also determine the state of an individual
         depending on their bio-sensor data. Furthermore, this information can
         be sent to emergency services to better prepare in helping personnel
         who have not made it to a designated safe-zone.

      </pre>

        <hr>
        <h3>Project Approach</h3>
        <p>
        We will be utilizing Nordic Semiconductor’s Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
        nRF52832 chipset and their accompanying development kit (nRF52) for this
        chipset to implement our Peripheral and Central devices. In conjunction
        with the nRF52-based Central device, we will be connecting a Raspberry
        Pi-0 via UART connection in order to have WiFi & internet connectivity.
        </p>
        <p>
        The Peripheral device acts as an advertising agent that broadcasts packets
        specific to a universally unique identifier (UUID), where only Central devices
        that are scanning for broadcasts identified by that UUID can receive those
        advertised packets. The packet payload will initially contain information
        regarding which peripheral device is broadcasting that packet, as well as
        a received signal strength indication (dbm represented in one byte as a
        two’s complement integer value). By having a network of Central devices
        places throughout an outdoor facility, each Central device will be constantly
        scanning for Peripheral devices and  reading their advertised packet data.
        Each Central device will then periodically send a list of its scanned
        Peripheral devices and their data via the Raspberry Pi-0 to our backend
        server as JSON data over a direct socket connection. The backend webserver
        will read this JSON data on a specified socket, where RSSI values for each
        Peripheral device’s advertising packet will be run through a Kalman filter
        for statistically accurate conversion to a distance value. Once these distance
        values have been calculated, we can trilaterate the position of that
        Peripheral device with respect to its three nearest Central devices.
        </p>
        <p>
        The backend webserver will be implemented using the Python Flask framework,
        since it is lightweight, but very extensible. It is framework that our
        team has experience with already and has a relatively quick development
        time to implement an API and socket server. Furthermore, data collection
        and parsing ease is greatly enhanced when all the data is JSON formatted.
        Also, from this Python-Flask server application, we can also use it to
        host our web-based dashboard where we can the present the state of our
        ecosystem in a user-friendly way. From the web-based dashboard we plan
        to show all the Central (fixed location) and Peripheral (individuals
        wearing our smart hard-hats) overlaid on a map of that outdoor facility.
        We can display the results of a Peripheral device trilateration on this map,
        and determine which individuals have made it to a designated safe zone,
        are on moving towards one, or are completely immobile.
        </p>

        <h3>Project Objectives</h3>
        <p>
        The objective of Project BlueHat is to provide a working system of BLE
        Central & Peripheral devices, where each Central device will periodically
        relay to the our backend webserver a list of scanned nearby Peripheral
        devices. The backend webserver is where we offload heavy calculation
        such as Kalman Filtering and trilateration of peripheral devices,
        which we can then present this information on our web-dashboard
        in a user-friendly manner. Therefore our goals for this quarter is
        to design and develop the system described previously as well as
        carry-out some real-world outdoor testing, since this system is
        intended to be used outdoors.
        </p>

        <h3>Major Deliverables</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Central & Peripheral Hardware (nRF52 & Raspberry Pi-0) - May 13rd, 2017
              Hardware Sub-Team: Moiz Qureshi & Ben Chafik</li>
          <li>Backend Webserver (API & Sockets) using Python Flask - May 13rd, 2017
              Cloud Software Sub-Team: Ye Huang & Eduardo Rosales</li>
          <li>Kalman Filtering Algorithm (on backend webserver) - May 20th, 2017
              Whole Team: Moiz Qureshi, Ben Chafik, Ye Huang, & Eduardo Rosales</li>
          <li>Trilateration Algorithm (on backend webserver) - May 28th, 2017

          <li>Web-based, user-friendly dashboard - June 2nd, 2017
              Whole Team: Moiz Qureshi, Ben Chafik, Ye Huang, & Eduardo Rosales</li>
          <li>System-wide Test - June 5th, 2017
              Whole Team: Moiz Qureshi, Ben Chafik, Ye Huang, & Eduardo Rosales</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Time permitting and if we are ahead of schedule, we will also be integrating
           bio-sensors such as a pulse sensor to the Peripheral device to also relay
           individual pulse data along with RSSI to nearby Central devices.
        </p>

        <hr>
        <h3>Constraints, Risk, & Feasibility</h3>
        <p>
          The only major risks we face pertain to the algorithms that we will be
          implementing on the backend webserver, specifically the Kalman filtering
          and trilateration algorithms. The accuracy of RSSI values (between Central
           and Peripheral devices) without any Kalman filtering are not suitable for
            distance estimation within 1-3 meters. No one in the team has experience
            with Kalman filtering, however we have already began researching this
            algorithm and have found several research papers implementing it in
            similar use cases. Furthermore, we have developed a solid plan to mock
            RSSI data in order to train and test our implementation of the Kalman
            filter algorithm. By doing this we can statistically analyze the accuracy
             of real RSSI values pre and post Kalman filtering, in order to achieve
             a distance estimation within our goal of 1-3 meters. Once we established
             a working implementation of our Kalman filter, trilaterationof a
             Peripheral device from the three nearest Central devices will be trivial.
           </p>
           <p>Other minor risks include:</p>
           <ul>
             <li>One or more member could fall sick and not be able to perform/deliver.</li>
             <li>Inability to pick up/learn new techniques and languages that are crucial to the development.</li>
             <li>Other classes and commitments, they could potential cause us to fall behind.</li>
             <li>Devices malfunction and would need to reorder which takes time.</li>
            </ul>

      </div>
      <p>
        The project splits into two halves, a server half and a firmware half.
        Because of this we are splitting the development between two sub-groups
         and assigned one half to a single sub-group.
       </p>
      <h3>Server Sub-Team:</h3>
      <p>
        This is the backend server group, consists of Eduardo Rosale and Ye Huang.
        They are assigned the role to setup a webserver where the central devices
        going to communicate with, do their calculation and then update the dashboard.
      </p>

      <p>
        The backend webserver is going to be using Flask Server Framework and SocketIO.
        These two frameworks/libraries are free and available to be used. Flask Server
        is going to help us implement a database where we can store and read information
        while SocketIO is going to help us communicate/connect with RPi0 (Raspberry pi 0)
        which are the server’s main and only clients.
      </p>

      <p>
        The central devices fill a JSON with informations needed then feeds it back
        (using RPi0) to the server, as we are still developing these central devices
        we are going to have to test the web-server with mocking JSON payload sent by
        us to the web-server and compare output with expected output. All the tests
        done are going to be document containing input, output, expected output and comments.
      </p>

      <p>
      Backend server will have its own proper documentation denoting different HTTP
      routes and HTTP verbs used. For example GET and POST to give and get information,
      respectively. In addition, the documentation will include a description of the
      JSON of information required by the server.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Firmware Sub-Team:</h3>
      <p>
        This is the embedded systems group, consists of Moiz Qureshi and Aymane Chafik (Ben).
         They are assigned the role to setup the central and peripheral devices.
         The central devices will be embedded to retrieve information from the peripheral
         devices and then using a serial connection (UART) to the RPi0 the central
         device is then able to send the information to the web-server.
       </p>
      <p>
        Both Peripheral and central are going to be implemented with NRF52 each.
        This device costs about $40 each, we have already ordered it and is on hand.
        NRF52 uses ARM-GCC to compile C code and is free to use. In addition to Peripheral,
        the central device is going to include an RPi-0. The RPi-0 is going to allow
        the NRF52 constructing the central device to connect to the internet and thus
        communicate with the server. The RPi-0 costs $10 and has also been ordered and delivered.
      </p>
      <p>
        Testing for embedded devices is going to be done manually by analyzing output
        of our firmware. This is to check and see if the nearby devices (a.k.a peripherals)
        are scanned correctly. In addition we will be using Nordic Semiconductor Computer
         Application tools to see if we are able to gather the information needed is written
         and caught properly.
       </p>
      <p>
        This part will not include any API documentation. However, it will include
         a test report documentation where we document test results such as recording
         the rssi values at known distances in open air of peripheral-to-central.
       </p>
      <p>
        Outside of the sub-groups, when we are all together, we will be documenting
        those weekly design reviews. This documentation will include progress,
        issues or plusses on our weekly milestones/deliverables.
